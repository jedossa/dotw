### gitpod

To start the repository in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) just use the below link:

https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jedossa/dotw

### sbt

> First, make sure `code`, the binary for Visual Studio Code, is on your `$PATH`,
  this is the case if you can start the IDE by running `code` in a terminal. This
  is the default on all systems except Mac where you'll need to follow these
  instructions: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_command-line

From repository path just run:

```shell
sbt launchIDE
```
